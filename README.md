# NFT-FILL-ERC721-POC-Implementation
A first of its kind implementation of an NFT DeFi asset

What is this NFT about?

Bob and Alice example.

1: Bob mints an nft asset with the image of a key.

2: Bob loads 200.000$ ETH into the nft asset.

3: Bob sells that asset to Alice for 210.000$.

4: Alice loads 100.000$ ETH into the nft asset.

5: Alice sells the nft asset to her friend Oscar for 350.000$.

At this point 300.000$ are contained inside the nft-fill asset and 50.000$ was the last market speculation of the paired nft value.

In future commits the NFT-FILL asset will be able to receive not just eth but many other currencies at the same time.
